- ✅ Node.js 18 environment
- ✅ Yarn package manager
- ✅ Production build process
- ✅ Pages artifact upload

## 🚀 Deployment Process

1. **Code Push**: When you push to `main` branch
2. **Build Trigger**: GitHub Actions automatically starts
3. **Install Dependencies**: `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`
4. **Build App**: `yarn build` (creates optimized production build)
5. **Deploy**: Uploads `dist/` folder to GitHub Pages
6. **Live**: App is immediately available at your Pages URL

## 🔄 Future Updates

To update your live app:
1. Make changes in a feature branch
2. Merge to develop
3. Create a release
4. Merge release to main
5. Push main branch - automatic deployment!

Example:
```bash
./scripts/start-feature.sh "new-quiz-categories"
# Make your changes
./scripts/finish-feature.sh "new-quiz-categories"
./scripts/create-release.sh "1.1.0"
./scripts/finish-release.sh "1.1.0"
git push origin main  # Triggers automatic deployment
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check the **Actions** tab for error details
2. Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json`
3. Verify build process works locally: `yarn build`
4. Check that `dist/` folder is created after build

### If app doesn't load:
1. Verify the base path in `vite.config.ts`
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Ensure repository name matches the base path

## 📊 Monitoring

After deployment, monitor:
- **GitHub Actions**: Build and deployment status
- **Repository Insights**: Traffic and usage statistics
- **Issues**: User feedback and bug reports
