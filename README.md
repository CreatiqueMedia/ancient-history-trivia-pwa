### CSS and Styling

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling with PostCSS processing:

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **PostCSS**: CSS post-processor that handles Tailwind compilation
- **Custom CSS**: Additional styles in `src/index.css` using `@layer` directive
- **Dark Mode**: Built-in dark/light theme switching
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop breakpoints

#### VS Code Integration

The project includes VS Code settings (`.vscode/settings.json`) that:
- Disable default CSS validation to prevent Tailwind directive warnings
- Enable Tailwind CSS IntelliSense for TypeScript/React files
- Provide proper autocomplete for Tailwind classes
- Support Emmet completions in TypeScript files

If you see CSS warnings for `@tailwind` or `@apply` directives, ensure you have the Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension installed.

#### Custom Styles

Custom component styles are defined in `src/index.css` using Tailwind's `@layer components`:

```css
@layer components {
  .btn-primary {
    @apply bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700 text-white font-medium py-3 px-6 rounded-lg transition-colors duration-200;
  }
  .card {
    @apply bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-xl shadow-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700;
  }
}
```
