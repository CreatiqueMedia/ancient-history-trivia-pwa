### PWA Configuration

PWA settings can be modified in `vite.config.ts`:

- Manifest settings (name, icons, theme colors)
- Service worker configuration
- Caching strategies
- Offline behavior

### CSS and Styling

This project uses Tailwind CSS for styling with PostCSS processing:

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **PostCSS**: CSS post-processor that handles Tailwind compilation
- **Custom CSS**: Additional styles in `src/index.css` using `@layer` directive
- **Dark Mode**: Built-in dark/light theme switching
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with desktop breakpoints

#### VS Code Integration

The project includes VS Code settings (`.vscode/settings.json`) that:
- Disable default CSS validation to prevent Tailwind directive warnings
- Enable Tailwind CSS IntelliSense for TypeScript/React files
- Provide proper autocomplete for Tailwind classes
- Support Emmet completions in TypeScript files

If you see CSS warnings for `@tailwind` or `@apply` directives, ensure you have the Tailwind CSS IntelliSense extension installed.

#### Custom Styles

Custom component styles are defined in `src/index.css` using Tailwind's `@layer components`:

```css
@layer components {
  .btn-primary {
    @apply bg-primary-600 hover:bg-primary-700 text-white font-medium py-3 px-6 rounded-lg transition-colors duration-200;
  }
  .card {
    @apply bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-xl shadow-lg border border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700;
  }
}
```

## Data Structure

  correctAnswer: number;
  explanation: string;
  difficulty: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard';
  category: string;
  region: string;
  timesPeriod: string;

# Quarterly Trivia Bundle Delivery & Cloud Integration

## Automated Quarterly Release Workflow

This project is designed for seamless, versioned delivery of new trivia question bundles every quarter. The workflow is fully automated and cloud-based for future-proofing and app store compliance.

### 1. Exporting Bundles

- Use the script at `scripts/export-bundles.ts` to export all non-format question bundles.
- Each bundle contains exactly 100 questions, evenly mixed between true/false, fill-in-the-blank, and multiple choice.
- Format Packs are excluded from this export.
- The script outputs a versioned JSON file (e.g., `public/trivia-bundles-2025-Q3.json`).

**Run:**
```bash
yarn ts-node scripts/export-bundles.ts
```

### 2. Uploading to Supabase Storage

- Use the script at `scripts/upload-bundles-to-supabase.ts` to upload the exported JSON file to your Supabase Storage bucket.
- Requires environment variables `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (see your Supabase project settings).
- The file is versioned for easy rollback and automation.

**Run:**
```bash
SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... yarn ts-node scripts/upload-bundles-to-supabase.ts
```

### 3. App Integration

- The app fetches the latest bundle from Supabase Storage at runtime.
- Sample quiz buttons always use the correct questions for each bundle.
- All navigation and data loading is robust and future-proof.

### 4. Quarterly Release Checklist

- [ ] Update or add new questions in `src/data/`
- [ ] Run the export script to generate the new bundle JSON
- [ ] Upload the bundle to Supabase Storage
- [ ] Test the app with the new bundle (web and mobile)
- [ ] Announce the new release to users
