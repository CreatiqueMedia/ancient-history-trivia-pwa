2. Read `/MANDATORY_CHECKLIST.md`  
3. Reference this `.ai-guardrails/` folder

## üõ°Ô∏è PURPOSE:

- Deploy issues  
- Development frustration
- Time waste

Following these guardrails ensures:
- Working Stripe-only solutions
- Consistent architecture
- Zero Firestore references
- Successful builds and deploys
