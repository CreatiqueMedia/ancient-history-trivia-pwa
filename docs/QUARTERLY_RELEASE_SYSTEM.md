# Automated Quarterly Question Pack Release System

## Overview
This document outlines a robust, scalable, and automated system for releasing new question pack versions every quarter (March, June, September, December) to maximize revenue generation.

## üéØ Business Goals
- Generate continuous revenue through version releases
- Maintain customer engagement with fresh content
- Build anticipation for quarterly updates
- Create opportunities for upselling and cross-selling
- Establish recurring revenue streams

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### 1. Content Generation Pipeline

#### AI-Powered Question Generation
```typescript
// Future AI Service Integration
class AIQuestionGeneratorService {
  async generateQuestions(theme: string, difficulty: string, count: number): Promise<Question[]> {
    // Integration with OpenAI GPT-4, Claude, or custom models
    // Prompt engineering for historical accuracy
    // Fact-checking and validation
  }
  
  async validateHistoricalAccuracy(questions: Question[]): Promise<ValidationResult> {
    // Cross-reference with historical databases
    // Expert review suggestions
    // Accuracy scoring
  }
}
```

#### Quality Control Workflow
1. **AI Generation** ‚Üí Generate initial question sets
2. **Expert Review** ‚Üí Historical accuracy validation
3. **Community Testing** ‚Üí Beta testing with select users
4. **Final Approval** ‚Üí Quality assurance sign-off

### 2. Firebase Integration for Scalability

#### Database Structure
```javascript
// Firebase Firestore Collections
collections = {
  questionPacks: {
    [packId]: {
      baseId: "region_pack_rome",
      version: "v2",
      releaseDate: "2025-09-01",
      questions: [...],
      sampleQuestions: [...],
      isCurrentVersion: true,
      status: "published" | "draft" | "archived"
    }
  },
  
  versionHistory: {
    [packId]: {
      versions: [
        { version: "v1", releaseDate: "2025-06-01", status: "legacy" },
        { version: "v2", releaseDate: "2025-09-01", status: "current" }
      ]
    }
  },
  
  releaseSchedule: {
    quarters: {
      "2025-Q3": {
        releaseDate: "2025-09-01",
        packs: ["region_pack_rome_v2", "region_pack_egypt_v2"],
        status: "planned" | "in_progress" | "released"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Firebase Functions for Automation
```javascript
// Automated release function
exports.quarterlyRelease = functions.pubsub
  .schedule('0 0 1 3,6,9,12 *') // First day of quarters
  .onRun(async (context) => {
    // Publish new versions
    // Archive old versions to legacy
    // Send notifications to users
    // Update pricing tiers
  });
```

### 3. Revenue Optimization Strategy

#### Pricing Tiers for Versions
- **Current Version**: Full price ($1.99)
- **Previous Version**: Discounted price ($0.99)
- **Legacy Versions (2+ versions old)**: Bundle deals ($4.99 for 3 packs)

#### Subscription Model Enhancement
```typescript
interface VersionAccessTier {
  tier: 'free' | 'basic' | 'premium' | 'ultimate';
  currentVersionAccess: boolean;
  previousVersionAccess: boolean;
  legacyVersionAccess: boolean;
  earlyAccess: boolean; // Access 1 week before public release
}
```

## ü§ñ Automated Release Workflow

### Phase 1: Content Preparation (Month 1)
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[AI generates questions] --> B[Expert review]
    B --> C[Beta testing]
    C --> D[Content approval]
    D --> E[Firebase upload]
```

### Phase 2: Pre-Release (Month 2)
- **Week 1-2**: Marketing campaign preparation
