- Custom dashboards and alerts
- Integration with existing analytics service
- Can track conversion funnels in detail

**Cons:**
- More development work required
- Need to implement custom alerting system

### Option 3: Enterprise Solution (Google Analytics 4 + Stripe Sigma)
**Best for**: High-volume applications with complex analytics needs

**Pros:**
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Real-time alerts and monitoring
- Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis
- BigQuery integration for custom queries

**Cons:**

- More complex setup and maintenance

## Implementation Recommendation: Option 1

### Phase 1: Enable Firebase Analytics (Immediate)
1. **Add Firebase Analytics to config**
2. **Update analytics service to use Firebase Analytics**
3. **Track key user events**: quiz completion, purchases, engagement
4. **Set up conversion tracking** for trial-to-paid conversions

### Phase 2: Configure Stripe Monitoring (Week 1)
1. **Set up Stripe Dashboard alerts** for failed payments, disputes
2. **Configure webhook monitoring** for payment events
3. **Set up revenue tracking** and subscription metrics
4. **Create payment failure alerts**

### Phase 3: Advanced Monitoring (Week 2-3)
1. **Set up Firebase Performance Monitoring**
2. **Configure Crashlytics** for error tracking
3. **Create custom dashboards** for key business metrics
4. **Set up automated alerts** for critical issues

## Key Metrics to Track

### User Engagement
- Daily/Monthly Active Users

- Time spent in app
- Feature usage (store, achievements, etc.)

### Business Metrics
- Trial-to-paid conversion rate
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)
- Churn rate
- Average revenue per user (ARPU)

### Technical Metrics
- App performance (load times, crashes)
- Payment success/failure rates
- API response times
- Error rates by feature

### Security Metrics
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limiting triggers
- Unusual activity patterns
- Geographic access patterns

## Cost Analysis

### Firebase Analytics (Free Tier)
- ✅ Up to 500 distinct events
- ✅ 25 user properties
- ✅ 10 custom definitions
- ✅ 1 year of data retention

### Stripe Dashboard (Free)
- ✅ Payment analytics
- ✅ Revenue tracking
- ✅ Basic reporting
- ✅ Webhook monitoring

### Total Monthly Cost: $0
**Perfect for current scale with room to grow**

## Privacy & Compliance

### GDPR Compliance

## Next Steps

1. **Enable Firebase Analytics** (30 minutes)
2. **Configure Stripe alerts** (1 hour)
3. **Set up monitoring dashboards** (2 hours)
4. **Test and validate tracking** (1 hour)
5. **Document monitoring procedures** (30 minutes)

**Total implementation time: ~5 hours**
**Ongoing maintenance: ~1 hour/month**

This approach provides comprehensive monitoring while keeping costs minimal and maintenance simple.
