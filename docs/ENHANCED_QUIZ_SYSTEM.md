## Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

#### New Service Layer
- **`src/services/EnhancedQuizService.ts`** - Core quiz generation logic
  - `generateQuickQuiz()` - Creates balanced quick quizzes
  - `generateBundleSampleQuiz()` - Handles bundle-specific quiz generation
  - `getQuestionDisplayInfo()` - Provides enhanced metadata for UI display
  - `validateQuizDistribution()` - Ensures proper difficulty distribution

#### Enhanced UI Components
- **`src/screens/QuizScreen.tsx`** - Updated quiz interface
  - Enhanced question metadata display
  - Visual difficulty indicators
  - Historical age and region information
  - Educational level context

#### Data Layer Updates
- **`src/data/questions.ts`** - Added enhanced question selection
  - `getEnhancedRandomQuestions()` - Proper distribution for quick quiz
  - Backward compatibility maintained

### Quiz Distribution Logic

#### Quick Quiz Algorithm
```typescript
// 33% Easy, 33% Medium, 33% Hard distribution
const easyCount = Math.floor(questionCount * 0.33);
const mediumCount = Math.floor(questionCount * 0.33);
const hardCount = questionCount - easyCount - mediumCount;

// Select questions with format variety
selectedQuestions.push(...selectQuestionsWithFormatMix(easyQuestions, easyCount));
selectedQuestions.push(...selectQuestionsWithFormatMix(mediumQuestions, mediumCount));
selectedQuestions.push(...selectQuestionsWithFormatMix(hardQuestions, hardCount));
```

#### Bundle Sample Quiz Logic
```typescript
// Special handling for Difficulty Packs
if (bundle.category === 'difficulty') {
  return generateDifficultyPackQuiz(bundle, bundleQuestions, questionCount);
}

// All other bundles use mixed difficulty distribution
return generateMixedDifficultyQuiz(bundleQuestions, questionCount);
```

#### Difficulty Pack Exception
```typescript
// Maintain specific difficulty for Difficulty Packs
const targetDifficulty = bundle.difficulty;
const filteredQuestions = questions.filter(q => q.difficulty === targetDifficulty);
return selectQuestionsWithFormatMix(shuffledQuestions, questionCount);
```

## Enhanced UI Components

### Question Metadata Display

#### Regional Information
```jsx
<span className="bg-primary-100 text-primary-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full">
  üìç {questionDisplayInfo.region}
</span>
```

#### Historical Age Context
```jsx
<span className="bg-purple-100 text-purple-700 px-3 py-1 rounded-full">
  ‚è≥ {questionDisplayInfo.historicalAge}
</span>
```

#### Difficulty Level Indicator
```jsx
<div className={`inline-flex items-center px-4 py-2 rounded-lg ${difficultyStyles}`}>
  <span className="mr-2">{difficultyEmoji}</span>
  <span className="capitalize">{difficulty}</span>
  <span className="mx-2">‚Ä¢</span>
  <span>{educationalLevel}</span>
</div>
```

### Historical Age Mapping

The system intelligently maps question periods to recognizable historical ages:

- **Prehistoric Age**: Paleolithic, Neolithic, Mesolithic periods
- **Bronze Age**: Bronze Age civilizations and early metallurgy
- **Iron Age**: Iron Age cultures and advanced civilizations
- **Classical Antiquity**: Greek, Roman, and other classical civilizations
- **Early Medieval**: Viking Age and early medieval periods

### Educational Level Context

- **Elementary School Level**: Basic historical facts and simple concepts
- **Middle School Level**: More complex relationships and intermediate knowledge
- **High School Level**: Advanced analysis, complex historical concepts

## Testing & Validation

### Distribution Validation
```typescript
const validation = EnhancedQuizService.validateQuizDistribution(questions, {
  easy: 3,
  medium: 3,
  hard: 4
});

console.log('Distribution valid:', validation.isValid);
console.log('Issues:', validation.issues);
console.log('Actual distribution:', validation.actualDistribution);
```

### Quiz Statistics
```typescript
const stats = EnhancedQuizService.getQuizStatistics(questions);
console.log('Difficulty breakdown:', stats.difficultyBreakdown);
console.log('Region breakdown:', stats.regionBreakdown);
console.log('Format breakdown:', stats.formatBreakdown);
```

### Sample Test Cases

#### Quick Quiz Test
```typescript
const quickQuiz = EnhancedQuizService.generateQuickQuiz(10);
// Expected: ~3 easy, ~3 medium, ~4 hard questions
// Mixed regions and historical periods
```

#### Bundle Sample Quiz Test
```typescript
const bundleQuiz = EnhancedQuizService.generateBundleSampleQuiz('region_pack_rome', 10);
// Expected: ~3 easy, ~3 medium, ~4 hard Roman questions
```

#### Difficulty Pack Test
```typescript
const easyPack = EnhancedQuizService.generateBundleSampleQuiz('difficulty_pack_easy', 10);
// Expected: 10 easy questions only
```

## Question Format Distribution

### Current Implementation
The system currently focuses on difficulty distribution with format awareness built into the selection algorithm. Future enhancements will include:

### Planned Format Distribution
- **Multiple Choice**: 40% of questions
- **True/False**: 30% of questions  
- **Fill-in-the-Blank**: 30% of questions

### Format Selection Algorithm
```typescript
private static selectQuestionsWithFormatMix(questions: Question[], count: number): Question[] {
  // Future implementation will ensure format variety
  // Current: Random selection with format awareness
  // Planned: Intelligent format distribution
}
```

## Performance Considerations
