Title: "I created a free AP-level Ancient History trivia app - feedback welcome!"

Hey r/AncientHistory!

As a history educator, I was frustrated by the lack of quality, challenging ancient history resources. Most trivia apps are too elementary or focus on modern history.

So I created an Ancient History trivia PWA with 33 AP-level questions covering 8 major civilizations: Egypt, Greece, Rome, Mesopotamia, China, India, Maya, and Persia.

Features:
- Completely free
- No ads or data collection
- Works on any device
- Detailed explanations for learning
- Multiple question formats

I'd love feedback from this community! What would make it more valuable for history enthusiasts?
