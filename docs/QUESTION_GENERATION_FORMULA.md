## ‚ùì **FAQ: Why 33/33/34 and not 33/33/33?**

**Q:** Why do hard questions get 34 instead of 33?
**A:** To reach exactly 100 questions total. Since 33 + 33 + 33 = 99, we add one extra hard question to reach 100.

**Q:** Why hard questions and not easy or medium?
**A:** Hard questions provide the most educational value for advanced learners, so the extra question goes to the hardest difficulty level.

**Q:** Is this distribution fixed?
**A:** Yes, for standard bundles. Only difficulty packs (Elementary, Advanced, etc.) use 100% single difficulty.
