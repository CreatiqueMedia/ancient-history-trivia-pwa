## Notes

- The app is currently set up with the architecture and code for both payment systems, but the actual accounts, products, and API keys need to be configured.
- The Supabase integration is designed but requires an actual Supabase account and project setup.
- For app store submissions, plan for a review period of 1-3 days for each platform.
- RevenueCat offers a free tier that should be sufficient for initial launch.
- Stripe charges per transaction (2.9% + $0.30 for US transactions).
- Consider setting up a staging environment to test the entire payment flow before going to production.
